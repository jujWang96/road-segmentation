## Abstraction
In this project, we studied the application of the convolutional layers from pre-trained VGG 16 model on the problem of surface detection. We modulate the VGG net in a self-driving car lane-finding program by removing the 4th layer of VGG from the original model and changing the loss function to mean squared error. Our net returns lower and more stable losses.
